<h5 class="e- text-gray">Main approach</h5>
<p class="look">This is a tool for the whole family of developers, those who are not
familiar with the design of sites and do not know preprocessors like SASS but also
the great web design gurus.
<br><br>
It is a single file. CSS loaded with great components, browse through the documentation
and you will see its great potential and incredible styles.
<br><br>
<strong>Content rating A, For the whole family!</strong></p>
<br>
<h5 class="e- text-gray">A single CSS or SASS file</h5>

<p class="look">While we know that we only include a single CSS file, we work based on
our first approach, which is simple and for the whole family.
<br><br>
Even a single CSS file with the full package included is quite flexible, lightweight
and fun. Created for great style gurus and for non-experienced developers.
<br><br>
Use this file, extracting the greatest potential from its components and utilities.
<br><br>
For the experienced, the SASS source files are included.</p>
