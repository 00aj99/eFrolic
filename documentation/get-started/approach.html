<h5 class="e- text-gray">Main approach</h5>
<p class="look">This is a tool mainly aimed at developers who are not familiar with
the layout of sites and do not know about preprocessors like (Sass, Less, among others.)
<br><br>
For this reason we include several examples of the things you can create using this
framework, even so, do not underestimate its potential because it is also made for large
interface designers. Browse through the documentation and you will see its great
potential and incredible styles.
<br><br>
<strong>Content rating A, For the whole family!</strong></p>
<br>
<h5 class="e- text-gray">A single CSS file</h5>

<p class="look">While we know that we only include a single CSS file,
although you can download some separate components, but we only have one
main CSS file, we work based on our first
approach, which is to be simple and for the whole family.
<br><br>
Even a single Css file with the entire package included is quite flexible
and playful. Created for great style gurus and for non-experienced developers.
<br><br>
Use this file, extracting the greatest potential from its components and utilities.</p>
